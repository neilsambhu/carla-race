10/24/2023 11:14:58 AM: after importing only the AdditionalMaps tar file, the following error exists when running CARLA:

TODO: download the other 2 tar files.  
10/24/2023 12:21:53 PM: CARLA 0.9.14 installed.  
10/24/2023 12:22:25 PM: TODO: configure CARLA 0.9.14 Town04.  
10/24/2023 1:01 PM: TODO: spawn vehicle: choose vehicle to spawn: Tesla Model 3.  
10/24/2023 1:06 PM: TODO: decide if vehicle should be spawned through API or through manual_control.py window.  
10/24/2023 1:17 PM: TODO: get waypoint locations on map.  
10/24/2023 4:29 PM: TODO: review basic_agent.py to find waypoints.  
10/24/2023 4:31 PM: TODO: spawn vehicle through manual_control.py window.  
10/24/2023 5:23 PM: I changed the settings for asynchronous mode to synchronous mode. manual_control.py still reads asynchronous mode.  
10/24/2023 5:42 PM: I need to choose between (1) getting synchronous mode working and (2) understanding waypoints. I will reduce the rendering quality to get CARLA working and move on to the Autopilot waypoints.  
10/24/2023 7:53 PM: in the manual_control.py, find out how autopilot works.  
10/25/2023 10:38 AM: TODO: set synchronous mode as a parameter in manual_control.py.  
```
python manual_control.py --autopilot --filter "vehicle.tesla.model3" --sync
```
10/25/2023 10:41 AM: CARLA run
```
./CarlaUE4.sh -quality-level=Low -RenderOffScreen
```
10/25/2023 10:44 AM: reminder to myself: even though sync settings are set in manual_control.py, I will have to configure the waypoints manually. For example, I can modify the manual_control.py script myself.  
10/25/2023 10:53 AM: synchronous_mode and fixed_delta_seconds are set accurately.

10/25/2023 11:00 AM: TODO: find waypoints in manual_control.py. There might be a call from manual_control.py to basic_agent.py.  
10/25/2023 11:18 AM: TODO: find how autopilot navigates in manal_control.py.  
10/25/2023 11:23 AM: I cannot find where the autopilot calls low-level functions from manual_control.py.  
10/25/2023 1:03 PM: `manual_control.py` > autopilot start

```
if controller.parse_events(client, world, clock, args.sync):
                return
```
10/25/2023 3:34 PM: fine-grained Autopilot settings are probably not in the KeyboardControl class.  
10/25/2023 3:44 PM: fine-grained Autopilot settings might be in the World class.  
10/25/2023 4:25 PM: read traffic manager: "The Traffic Manager (TM) is the module that controls vehicles in autopilot mode in a simulation."  
10/25/2023 7:23 PM: manual_control.py > game_loop(args)
```
traffic_manager = client.get_trafficmanager()
traffic_manager.set_synchronous_mode(True)

```
self.player = self.world.try_spawn_actor(blueprint, spawn_point)
```
10/25/2023 7:42 PM: the search for the autopilot waypoints is not obviously in the traffic_manager nor world.player.

```
results are from no_rendering_mode.py and synchronous_mode.py.  
10/26/2023 12:00 PM: I think I will need to modify the car spawn script to collect my own data. Steps: (1) spawn car; (2) collect RGB data; (3) implement basic agent.  
10/26/2023 12:04 PM: BasicAgent search in examples.

```
10/26/2023 5:22 PM: automatic_control.py works like manual_control.py with autopilot enabled by default. automatic_control.py calls basic_agent.py. Important function in basic_agent.py:

    Adds a specific plan to the agent.

10/26/2023 7:19 PM: find waypoints or landmarks in Town04.  
10/27/2023 12:08 PM: must not use autopilot for movement through Town04: autopilot is built into CARLA. 
10/27/2023 12:14 PM: how do I define the navigation through Town04 for my own agent?
10/27/2023 12:31 PM: the agent can hit custom waypoints. How do I find waypoints? Try to spawn a vehicle at specific waypoints in Town04.

TODO: get RGB data from car.  
10/27/2023 2:00 PM: problem: I cannot set synchronous mode and have images saved to hard disk simulataneously. I probably need to configure a tick to have images saved.  
10/27/2023 2:18 PM: TODO: read examples/sensor_synchronization.py.  
10/27/2023 2:22 PM: 2023_10_24_02car.py cannot exist as synchronous mode and saving images to hard disk. Make a copy to 2023_10_27_03camera.py.  
10/27/2023 2:31 PM: What is the next step in getting the sensor data stored to hard disk? 
10/27/2023 7:43 PM: successfully saved RGB image from one waypoint.  
10/27/2023 7:56 PM: I have the waypoints. I have the RGB visual of the waypoints. I need to create an agent that can drive through waypoints.  
10/29/2023 3:42 PM: TODO: get full insight on CARLA Autopilot to see how it's driving.  
10/29/2023 3:58 PM: manual_control.py does not call any of the scripts in navigation/.  
10/29/2023 4:01 PM: find "set_autopilot"

There are only function calls and not function definitions.  
10/29/2023 4:06 PM: set_autopilot is part of the carla.Vehicle class.  
```

10/30/2023 4:41 PM: grep cuts off printing. SAMBHU23 needs to be rebooted.  
10/31/2023 11:29 AM: the carla.Vehicle class is part of the Python API. I will go through the Python API directory structure to see where autpilot exists.

11/12/2023 5:45 PM: I will find the choice of waypoints in the global_route_planner between the source and destination waypoints.  
11/12/2023 5:49 PM: GlobalRoutePlanner > trace_route  
11/12/2023 5:56 PM: macroscopic view: (1) waypoint navigation is more important to understand first than (2) maximizing speed.

```
for each waypoint pair, the path is extrapolated from the source until the path is close enough to the destination.

11/14/2023 12:47 PM: there is a limiting factor:

Note: checking out '0.9.15'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

12/18/2023 2:51 AM: collect GPS data again from Town04 from spawn point 0 to spawn point 335. Inquiry to ChatGPT: 
```
I'm using CARLA Simulator 0.9.14. I used CARLA Autopilot to drive a vehicle.tesla.model3 from spawn point 0 to spawn point 335 in Town04 in synchronous mode with a fixed_delta_seconds of 0.05. I collected the x, y, z coordinates of the location of the car, stored in '_out_07vehicle_location_AP' separated by spaces and line returns. 
Write code in Python 3.7 to (1) open CARLA Simulator from /opt/carla-simulator/CarlaUE4.sh and train a reinforcement learning agent using these ground truth data. The action spaces exist as throttle from 0.0 to 1.0, steer from -1.0 to 1.0, and brake from 0.0 to 1.0. 
Vehicle controls are applied as follows:
throttle, steer, brake = action
vehicle.apply_control(carla.VehicleControl(throttle=float(throttle), steer=float(steer), brake=float(brake)))
Collect RGB image data from the vehicle stored to '_out_16rl_custom2/{episode_number}_{frame_number}.png'. 
```
12/18/2023 3:21 AM: ChatGPT response is too vague. I will refine the inquiry.
```
I'm using CARLA Simulator 0.9.14. I used CARLA Autopilot to drive a vehicle.tesla.model3 from spawn point 0 to spawn point 335 in Town04 in synchronous mode with a fixed_delta_seconds of 0.05. I collected the x, y, z coordinates of the location of the car, stored in '_out_07vehicle_location_AP/Town04_0_335.txt' separated by spaces and line returns. Distance is calculated as follows in CARLA Simulator: the carla.Location class takes in as parameters x, y, and z float values; the carla.Location.distance() method takes as input a carla.location object and returns the Euclidean distance from this location to another one. The action spaces exist as throttle from 0.0 to 1.0, steer from -1.0 to 1.0, and brake from 0.0 to 1.0. Vehicle controls are applied as follows:
throttle, steer, brake = action
vehicle.apply_control(carla.VehicleControl(throttle=float(throttle), steer=float(steer), brake=float(brake)))
Write each line of code in Python 3.7 to train a reinforcement learning agent rewarded by minimizing the distance from these ground truth location data for each tick in the CARLA Simulator. I already have the code written to spawn the vehicle at spawn point 0 in Town04. I need the code that minimizes the distance from the ground truth data.
